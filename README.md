This marks my return to coding after three long years of break!
Hi, my name is Ogundeinde Adedamola. A seasoned consultant and tutor. Some refer to me as a computer geek. Well, this is just me again after three years of being a full time academician. I am back here to "coding my life away", just the way it used to be untill three years ago. I found a new "love" in the education sector. Now, i am back!

Signed, Sealed and Delivered 

Ogundeinde A.M, OCA, OCP
